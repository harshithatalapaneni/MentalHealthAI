            <h2>Intentional Self-Love</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
                Everyone talks about self-love, but what has to be done first to make it intentional? 
                We need to realize its importance; we are taught how to love everyone else but not ourselves. 
                Remember that our foundation is the relationship with ourselves, through understanding, acceptance, and protection.
                Once we master that, we can become warriors of our lives—strong enough to conquer any challenge. 
                No matter what happens, we know who we are, and by accepting it, we protect ourselves from negative influences. 
                Intentional self-love means prioritizing ourselves before others, and by living our best lives, we become examples for others.
                I invite you to an intentional self-love challenge. 
                Consider the factors that indicate a need for self-love and the signs that signal issues needing attention for a better life. 
                Four important points to discuss include:
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're experiencing mental distress or breakdown.</li>
                    <li>If you struggle to accept your feelings as they are.</li>
                    <li>If imagining a loved one in distress makes you uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li>If you find it hard to look at yourself retrospectively.</li>
                </ul>
                Reflect on how you’ve treated yourself in the past. 
                Challenge yourself to create a better action plan for improved results. 
                Think about your past circumstances and be honest with yourself. 
                Evaluate your self-love and choose to live your best life intentionally.
                Start planting seeds of love and inspire others.

            <h2>Movie Recommendation: "A Beautiful Mind"</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="static/image/a_beautiful_mind.jpg" alt="A Beautiful Mind" />
            <p>
                The 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind is a powerful film about life with a progressive mental health condition. 
                It was inspired by the true story of the Nobel Prize–winning mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. 
                The film explores Nash's quick ascent to fame for his research on game theory, which contradicts over a century’s worth of economic thought. 
                However, as the government vies for his attention, his paranoid schizophrenia takes control of his life, 
                leading him to believe that Soviet spies are after him. 
                “This film portrays a fascinating mind that is not like others around him,” says Ashley Peña, LCSW. 
                “It portrays a special case, as he does recover. While his diagnosis has been questioned, it’s clear he struggled with a thought or mood disorder that impacted him and those around him.” 
                “A Beautiful Mind is actually a favorite of mine,” Dr. Girgis says, noting that it challenges the stigma that people with mental health conditions lack intelligence or teachability.

            <p>
                Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental health conditions globally, affecting millions of individuals regardless of age or background. 
                These disorders encompass a range of conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. 
                People with anxiety disorders often experience overwhelming feelings of worry, fear, and apprehension that can interfere with their daily activities and overall quality of life.
                Symptoms can manifest both physically and emotionally, leading to issues such as restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances.
                Individuals may also engage in avoidance behaviors, steering clear of situations that trigger their anxiety, which can further limit their experiences and opportunities.
                Moreover, anxiety disorders can be exacerbated by stress, life changes, and trauma, making it crucial for affected individuals to seek support. 
                Treatment options, including therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes, can help manage symptoms and improve well-being.
                Understanding and addressing anxiety is essential, as it can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
